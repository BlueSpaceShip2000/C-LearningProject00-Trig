=====================================

This learning project will be a demonstration of the C++ math operators and expression concepts as taught by Tony Gaddis, 
Judy Walters, and Godfrey Muganda in "Starting out with C++, EARLY OBJECTS, ninth edition." Lesson is taken from page 62-65,
and page 84-92.

The use of string manipulators will also be a part of this project.

2/11/2018 - Update

Coding project complete for the most part. Fixed bug that allowed a -nan result from triangles with sides in descending order.
Would like to add further functionality to this project by showing the correspondence between sides and angles. For example,
The cout should say angle a, angle b, angle c with their respective sides, instead of the first angle, second angle, third angle. 
This could possibly be fixed by incorporating switch statements and cases depending on which side is the largest.
